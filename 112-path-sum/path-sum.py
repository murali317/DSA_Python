            right = dfs(root.right, c) # same with right also
            if not root.left and not root.right: # only check at leaf nodes.
                return c == targetSum
            return left or right # will return True if either left or right has True otherwise False - Without this line, the recursive calls would evaluate, but you'd lose the result of those evaluations and always return None or nothing â€” which would break the logic. So finally this line means If either subtree has a valid path, return True
