        # Implementing Greedy Approach.... This is a way of storing/ keep tracking of min_price & max_price to compare it with the later ones.
        # We calculate profit dynamically and keep updating max_profit.
        # We never go backâ€”this is why Greedy works well here.
        # time - O(n) space - O(1)

        # max_profit = 0
        # min_profit = float('inf')
        # for i in prices:
        #     min_profit = min(min_profit, i)
        #     max_profit = max(max_profit, i-min_profit)
        # return max_profit

        # KADANE'S ALGORITHM (1D DP approach) --------
        # INTUITION - fix 1 pointer at 0th index, keep checking upcoming elements < that element, if yes movethat pointer there. Else if check upcoming elements - this element diff > profit. IF yes, update the profit and return.
        # time - O(n) space - O(1)
