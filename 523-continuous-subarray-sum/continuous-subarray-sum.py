        # âœ… So Why Store mod values?
# We store all mod values of the prefix sum (not just 0) because:
# If prefix_sum % k == r at index i, and we later see the same r at index j,
# Then the sum of the subarray from index i+1 to j is divisible by k.
        # time - O(n)
        # space - O(min(n,k))

        total = 0
        for i, n in enumerate(nums): # we need indices as well.
            total += n
            r = total % k
            if r not in remainder: # if mod value not seen, store its index
