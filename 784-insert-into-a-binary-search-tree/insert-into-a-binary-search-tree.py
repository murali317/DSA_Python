        # ------------ RECURSION --------------------
        # time - O(h) - unlike normal DFS, there's no need to go both to left and right, as of BST property, if val<root, we go only to left and right in opposite case. That's it only one side and Thatâ€™s equal to the height of the path you took. so height is also same - it is defined as longest distance from root - a leaf. At each step, you eliminate half the tree (like binary search). Max number of steps = height of the tree = h
        # space - O(h)
        if not root: # if root is None
            return TreeNode(val) # this is where the insertion happens.
            # The recursive return connects the new node back into its correct place.

        else:
            root.right = self.insertIntoBST(root.right, val)
